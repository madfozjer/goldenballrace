#### Who is the best player in the world right now? Could Club World Club affect this year's ratings? All that and a few more spicy things in this article.

We can just put the entire Paris Saint-Germain lineup there and call it a day.

#### 2024/2025 Team of the Season (4-3-3)

##### GK: David Raya (Arsenal, Spain) -- 7.2 FotMob average rating, 70%+ save percentage

It might seem like a bold statement that David Raya can be considered the best in the world right now. But think about it. The Premier League shared the Golden Glove, one of the highest pure ratings amongst top goalkeepers, and his acrobatics and shot stopping skills are just pure class.

And also a late semi-final PSG exit from the Champions League with a penalty saved in the second match. He played amazingly this year in 55 matches, where he conceded only 34 goals in the Premier League and only 9 goals in the Champions League. Pretty good for a former Southport player, huh?

##### CB: Marquinhos (PSG, Brazil) -- 7.3 FotMob average rating, 94.6% passes completion

First Champions League winner on our list, captain of the amazing Paris squad. While he possesses strong defensive skills, it's not his best trait. But when it comes to ball progression, creativity and psychology, he can be considered one, if not the best. Also, he won a treble.

##### CB: Kim Min-Jae (Bayern München, South Korea) -- 7.3 FotMob average rating, overall great performance

This season was forgettable for many world-class defenders, but we managed to find a quiet hero from Bayern. 28-year-old South Korean centre-back who successfully secured the title even playing through injury for his team. Kim's presence on the field was phenomenal, and even if he hasn't been in his best form lately, he is still The Monster of world football.

##### LB: Nuno Mendes (PSG, Portugal) -- 7.4 FotMob average rating, pocketed Mohamed Salah

Nuno Mendes is 22 years old and already a solid defensive and offensive left-back option for star-filled Paris Saint-Germain. This season saw an astonishing performance vs. the best of the best teams, and nearly all of them were shut off partially thanks to this guy. And by the way, his stats show he loves big matches and scary opponents.

##### RB: Achraf Hakimi (PSG, Morocco) -- 7.9 FotMob average rating, 21 GA in 48 games

Ballon d'Or contender, x3 Champions League winner and one of the most extraordinary players this season. His best performance yet, where he delivered 21 goal involvements while also being solid in defence. Playing in France didn't make him worse, and he still ranks at the top in a lot of attacking metrics even in comparison with more traditional wing players. Let's not forget he created 9 goals in the Champions League and even one in the final.

##### CDM: Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich, Germany) -- 7.8 FotMob average rating, 3+10 as a CDM

Arguably, the most important position in many modern teams is defensive midfielder, as Kimmich is the heart and core of the squad. Joshua is a world-class defensive but also creative player.

with extraordinary levels of work with or without possession of the ball. One of the most complete midfielders out there and Bayern's number 6, who rarely fails to deliver.

##### CM: Vitinha (PSG, Portugal) -- 7.5 FotMob average rating, 90%+ percentile in ball progression stats

You need to move a ball upfield? Call Vitinha. He is arguably the best in the world in this. His creative vision, powerful shot and effective dribbling are on another level.

We can call him PSG's brain from now on, because he is that good and important. Quiet leader for the Champions League-winning side.

##### CM: Joao Neves (PSG, Portugal) -- 7.6 FotMob average rating, scored a record for most assists (4) in his first two Ligue 1 matches, surpassing Neymar's previous record.

I am scared, because Portugal's national team is that good if a 20-year-old guy performs that well at such a high level. Ranking 80%+ in all key offensive percentiles and also not falling to deliver

on the defensive front, it is world-class, and doing it in your first season of top 5 league football is more than extraordinary. Benfica made an amazing midfielder for years ahead.

##### LW: Raphinha (Barcelona, Brazil) --- 8.0 FotMob average rating, 56 goal involvements in 57 matches.

Messi numbers. Former Leeds United and Vitoria de Guimaraes player is the main Golden Ball contender, alongside Ousmane Dembélé. His strong left leg, speed and dribbling are key attributes.

That makes him one of the deadliest players in the world right now. It is hard not to compare him to Mbappé, but this season was Barcelona's, and this left wing position is his for this year.

Also, GBL PLAYER OF THE YEAR.

##### RW: Ousmane Dembélé (PSG, France) -- 7.9 FotMob average rating, 46 goal involvements in 49 matches

Paris starboy and this year's best career revival put Ousmane ahead of Mbappé on our list. Ballon d'Or contender and PSG's winning side number 10 is surely en route to France Football's top 3 this year. His workrate is higher than ever, and yes, he is not the cleanest xG to goals converter, but he surely overperformed with +4.4 G-xG according to fbref.com, his best to date. Who would ever guess that Luis Enrique will make the beast out of this fella and will force him to play a nearly perfect flexible sort-of false 9 role?

##### FW: Harry Kane (Bayern Munich, England) -- 7.8 FotMob average rating, 49 goals + assists in 46 matches.

He failed to win the Champions League for Bayern. He even failed to reach ageing Lewandowski's numbers this season. But carrying his club in the second leg against a strong Inter team, being one of the most consistent goalscorers in the world and also winning his first trophy made him a must-pick for this year's TOTY. As always, his key attributes are **powerful right leg shot, mindful passing and excelent pressing**.

#### Notable mentions:

###### Lamine Yamal

17-year-old Barcelona prodigy reached 39 goal involvements and 55 appearances in his second-ever professional football season. Any other season the European Golden Boy will surely be in the Team of the Season, but with so many historical performances from right-wing players and early Barcelona Champions League exit it was just not fair to other players to include him. But many people still suggest

that his media power can push him to Ballon d'Or greatness at such a young age.

##### Désiré Doué

Is there a new Messi vs Ronaldo rivalry coming up between Doué and Yamal? Two very young and talented teams with two star players with unbelievable stats at such a young age can be considered a sign.

of a new heating rivalry. Doué was just another young prodigy for many people before the Champions League final, but in such a playful manner he scored 2 goals and assisted one during the match that it was just hard to ignore him.

##### Michael Olise

New club, new country, Champions League level of football, and he proved that he can be reliable even at such a high level. 17+18 in 50 matches, and his best season yet could put him up there in many seasons, especially if Bayern reached the Munich final. But sadly for him, 2024/2025 is not that year.

##### Mohamed Salah

Carrying Liverpool on his shoulders at 32 years of age is certainly not an easy task, especially when Manchester City dominated the last 4 seasons. But he did it, and he did it like never before.

34 goals and 23 assists in all competitions won him the Premier League Golden Boot and also the Premier League Playmaker of the Season award. And losing to PSG does not look so bad after they demolished Inter 5-0, so maybe he still had a Ballon d'Or-worthy season and he will finally lift the long-awaited shiny award?

##### Robert Lewandowski

Another 30+ legends of a game on this list, who had a diabolical start to the season. 42 goals in all competitions earned him our respect because Lewa certainly aged very well.

and maybe even en route to win his last Champions League with Barcelona next year to finally receive the Golden Ball, and I wish it would be the first ever Double Ballon d'Or. He is worth it.

##### Kylian Mbappé

Bad start, but Ronaldo's record-breaking finish is Kylian's fairy tale this season. Despite initial struggles playing alongside Vini Jr. and Rodrygo, he found his form, even scoring a hat-trick in El Clasico.

But still, Real Madrid's problems in the playoff vs. injury-filled Arsenal, alongside managerial and tactical chaos around the team, just knocked him out of any talks about a potential Ballon d'Or for the two times World Cup finalist.

#### Pedri

Another Spanish football product and key player for Barcelona, who had a pretty quiet 6 goals and 8 assists deep midfield performance, just orchestrated the whole Barcelona with his defensive and offensive presence. He was awesome this season, and I see a potential record-breaking player in years to come.

Definitely, this season was very exciting and filled with historical performances, so just looking at stats is not enough to determine the best players or the sole best player this year. But for us, the best team you see is above, and the MVP is Raphinha with his crazy numbers and important goals. But Hakimi, Ousmane Dembélé and Mohamed Salah all can be considered MVPs for their clubs in one moment of the year or another. But consistency – it is what matters. Of course, they are not the best players in the world, even in their respective positions in raw talent or hard work, but they performed the best, and it is what matters in football.

Could the Club World Cup affect ratings or even the MVP of the season? I think we will see. Prize money and the honour of winning the first reformatted tournament are pretty huge motivations to give your 100%, so teams that participate and their players are close to being considered the best. I am talking about PSG, Bayern, Inter, Real Madrid and even Man Mancity's Haaland or Marmoush; they can leave their mark.
